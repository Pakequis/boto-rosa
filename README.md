# **Boto-Rosa**

![Splash screen](.\Images\splash.jpg)

The “Boto-Rosa” project is a proof of concept for a device that shares many functionalities with the Flipper Zero. It is designed to be cost-effective, with materials costing less than $35.00, and it can be assembled using off-the-shelf Arduino modules.

The firmware for the Boto-Rosa will be developed using the Arduino framework to facilitate understanding and allow easy modification by anyone.

The project is scheduled to be completed by December 2024 or first-half of 2025.
